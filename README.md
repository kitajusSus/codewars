## 1.  Build a pile of Cubes (.py)

### 1.1 Task
"Our construct a building which will be a pile of n cubes. The cube at the bottom will have a volume of n^3, the cube above will have volume of (n-1)^3 and so on until the top which will have a volume of 1^3."

## 2. Count IP Addresses (.py)
### Task:
"Implement a function that receives two IPv4 addresses, and returns the number of addresses between them (including the first one, excluding the last one).
All inputs will be valid IPv4 addresses in the form of strings. The last address will always be greater than the first one."

### Solution 
To solve this problem, you need to convert the IPv4 addresses to their numerical equivalents, then calculate the difference between them.

Steps:
Convert an IPv4 address to a numerical value:

Split the address into its four octets.
Each octet is an 8-bit number, so combine them into a 32-bit number.
For example, the IP "192.168.1.1" can be converted to a numerical value by computing:
$ 192 * 256^3 + 168 * 256^2 + 1 * 256^1 + 1 $
 
Compute the difference between the two numerical values:
