What's Going On in the Code
Class and Method:

We have a class called Solution and a method inside it named permute.
This method takes a list of numbers called nums and returns all possible permutations of these numbers.
Early Return for Single Element:

If the list has only one number, the method just returns a list containing that single number. This is a quick check to handle the simplest case right away.
Backtracking Function:

There's a helper function inside permute called backtrack. This function does the heavy lifting.
The start parameter keeps track of the position in the list where we are currently making swaps to generate permutations.
Base Case:

If start is equal to the length of nums, it means we've built a complete permutation. So, we add a copy of nums to the result list res.
Swapping and Recursion:

For each position start, the function swaps the current element with each element that comes after it (including itself).
It then recursively calls backtrack with the next position (start + 1).
After the recursive call, it swaps the elements back to their original places to try the next possible permutation.
Result List:

res is the list where we store all the permutations we find.
After calling backtrack starting from position 0, we return res.
Step-by-Step Example
Let's walk through an example with nums = [1, 2, 3]:

Initial Call:

permute is called with nums = [1, 2, 3].
res is initialized as an empty list.
backtrack is called with start = 0.
First Level of Recursion (start = 0):

Swap nums[0] with nums[0] (no change): nums = [1, 2, 3].
Call backtrack with start = 1.
Second Level of Recursion (start = 1):

Swap nums[1] with nums[1] (no change): nums = [1, 2, 3].
Call backtrack with start = 2.
Third Level of Recursion (start = 2):

Swap nums[2] with nums[2] (no change): nums = [1, 2, 3].
Call backtrack with start = 3.
Base Case (start = 3):

start is equal to the length of nums, so add [1, 2, 3] to res.
Backtrack to start = 2:

Swap back nums[2] with nums[2] (no change): nums = [1, 2, 3].
Try the next swap: swap nums[2] with nums[1]: nums = [1, 3, 2].
Call backtrack with start = 2.
Continue Recursion and Backtracking:

Repeat the process, swapping elements and calling backtrack, until all permutations are generated and added to res.
Final Result:

After all recursive calls and backtracking are done, res will contain all permutations of nums.
